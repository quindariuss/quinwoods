# Welcome Logic Travelers 
In this stop in your journey you have stumbled upon a particularly interesting nook within the World Wide Web. It is filled with gems, trash and everything else a young writer can think of. I hope what you need is found here, because here is where the imagination is tested. We look to build the world around us in the order in which we see fit only limited by ability that we shall soon wish to become null in such an endeavor. 
## About the Creator
A man, who grew up on Harry Potter that believed past his time that magic was real. Well the jokes on everyone else because it is and I practice it here. Other than that we try to do write a little bit of everything here. It would be useless to list because it would be outdated before a fortnight so the creator will be selfish with his time and ask if you look around. 
## How to Contact the Creator
